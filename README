GTK highlighting for TML markup. Works in GTKSourceView-based code such as Gedit, Xed etc. (failed in an attempt to get highlighting working in Geany)

The instructions are in the INSTALL file. There's a shell script `highlight_gtk_tml`. It's worked before, but may be defeated by new versions of GtkSourceView. The script needs 'sudo' permission. Use,
~~~
./highlight_gtk_tml
